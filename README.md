# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy dataset that can be used for later analysis.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

## Creating the Dataset
The R script called `run_analysis.R` needs to be executed to create the tidy dataset. In order to run it, you need to have the UCI HAR Dataset in the source directory/ working directory. The tidy dataset is produced by implementing the following steps:  

- Read data.
- Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Create a second, independent tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- Write the data set to the `tidy_data.txt` file.
